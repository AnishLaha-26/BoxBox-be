# 📬 Mail App UI

This is the frontend UI for the Mail Assistant desktop application — a privacy-first, intelligent email client that helps you identify and respond to important emails instantly.

Built using:
- 🔹 SvelteKit for modern reactive UI
- 🎨 TailwindCSS for clean and customizable styling
- 🧠 Connected to a local backend (Tauri) for offline functionality, email sync, and AI classification

This app is intended to be embedded in a Tauri desktop environment, but can also be run standalone for development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
